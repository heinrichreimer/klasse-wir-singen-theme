# ðŸŽ¨ klasse-wir-singen-theme

Klasse! Wir singen [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) theme, based on the [Dara theme](https://wordpress.com/theme/dara) ([source](https://github.com/Automattic/themes/tree/trunk/dara)).
With bold featured images and bright, cheerful colors, this theme is specially customized for the [Klasse! Wir singen](https://klasse-wir-singen.de/) project.
The theme requires at least WordPress 4.5 and is tested up to 4.7.

## Installation

1. In your admin panel, go to _Appearance_ > _Themes_ and click the _Add New_ button.
2. Click _Upload_ and _Choose File_, then select the theme's .zip file. Click _Install Now_.
3. Click _Activate_ to use your new theme right away.

### Plugin support

The theme includes support for [Jetpack's](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack) Infinite Scroll, Social Menus, and Featured Content.

### Front Page Setup

When you first activate this theme, your homepage will display posts in a traditional blog format. If you would like to use a static front page, follow these steps:

- Publish two pages with titles that are easy to remember, like Home and Blog. To publish a page, navigate to Pages â†’ Add Page.
- Go to Customize â†’ Static Front Page.
- Select "A static page" and choose the two pages you published in Step #1 as your Front page and Posts page.

The static front page includes the following:

- A Featured Content area with a slider.
- Three Featured Pages, set in Customize â†’ Theme Options.

### Featured Content Slider (requires [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/))

The Featured Content slider appears on the front of your site. To add a post or page to the slider, give it the tag featured or another tag of your choosing set from Customize â†’ Featured Content.

If no Featured Content tag is set, the Featured Image for the page will display here instead.

### Front-page Featured Pages

On the front page, a section can be populated with three Featured Pages, each with a title, Featured Image, and excerpt. To enable this feature, follow these directions:

- Publish the three pages you would like to feature on your front page, and upload Featured Images for each page.
- Go to Customizer â†’ Theme Options.
- Use the three drop-down menus to select the pages you'd like to feature.
- Click Save and Publish.

The pages featured in this area will automatically occupy the entire width of your site. For example, a single featured page will occupy the entire column, two Featured Pages will divide the space into two columns, three Featured Pages will divide the space into three columns.

#### Custom Menus

The theme includes one Custom Menu in the header, which can be configured via My Sites â†’ Menus. If no menu is assigned, this area will display a list of your pages by default.

#### Social Links Menu (requires [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/))

With this theme, you have the option to display links to your social media profiles in the header and footer. To display them, set up a Social Links Menu.

### Widget Areas

The theme offers four widget areas:

- The optional Sidebar, which appears on the right in blog view and on pages using the default template.
- Three optional Footer widget areas.

If the Sidebar area is not active, the theme automatically adjusts to have a single column.

### Site Logo

Brand identity is very important. Thatâ€™s why this theme supports the Site Logo feature. To add your own image, go to Customize â†’ Site Identity. The logo will appear in the header, above the site title.

### Custom Background

Custom color, pattern, or a beautiful image â€“ the choice is yours. To change the background, visit Customize â†’ Colors & Backgrounds from your dashboard.

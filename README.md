# ðŸŽ¨ klasse-wir-singen-theme

Klasse! Wir singen [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) theme, based on the [Dara theme](https://wordpress.com/theme/dara) ([source](https://github.com/Automattic/themes/tree/trunk/dara)).

## Installation

1. In your admin panel, go to _Appearance_ > _Themes_ and click the _Add New_ button.
2. Click _Upload_ and _Choose File_, then select the theme's .zip file. Click _Install Now_.
3. Click _Activate_ to use your new theme right away.

### Front Page Setup

When you first activate this theme, your homepage will display posts in a traditional blog format. If you would like to use a static front page, follow these steps:

- Publish two pages with titles that are easy to remember, like Home and Blog. To publish a page, navigate to Pages â†’ Add Page.
- Go to Customize â†’ Static Front Page.
- Select "A static page" and choose the two pages you published in Step #1 as your Front page and Posts page.

#### Custom Menus

The theme includes two Custom Menus, one in the header and one in the footer, which can be configured via My Sites â†’ Menus. If no menu is assigned, this area will display a list of your pages by default.
